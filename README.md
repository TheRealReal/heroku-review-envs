# heroku-review-envs

Review Environments built on the Heroku platform, using their Review Apps functionality.

## Purpose

If you need to support testing and development of microservices environments, and you're using the Review Apps Beta functionality on the Heroku platform, this is a (set of) GitHub Actions that will help you run those microservices.

## Why ReviewApps Beta?

We'll be trying to keep with the Heroku roadmap in order to extend the usefulness of this code. Your organization / team will need access to the ReviewApps Beta in order to use this.
